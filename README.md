Project Title:
Random Number Memorization






# Project Description:
Our app will be a fun and challenging number memorization test where random numbers will be generated, shown to the user briefly and then must be guessed by the user. In particular, a digit will be added on to the end of the number each round and everytime the user guesses all digits in the correct order, they will get a point for that round. If the number is guessed incorrectly (wrong number/ order), then the user must restart a new game from the beginning. The main overall goal of this app is to make a game where the user tries their best to get higher and higher scores by memorizing more and more digits, thus improving their memory. Also, difficulty settings that will challenge the user even more such as giving less and less time for each round. To make the game more meaningful, we will add a scoreboard/leaderboard so that whoever plays our game can compare with other scores and see how well they perform against others. There will also be a choice between two modes, normal and hard mode. Normal will be a regular mode with digits 0-9 to remember and a hard mode that includes 0-9 and a-z.



Requirements Definition:

Users will be welcomed to the app with a main menu/ start up screen 


On the main menu screen, the user may select a play the game button, see a description of the game or view a leaderboard


User can select a difficulty of the game by selecting either normal or hard mode 


Users can play the normal mode where a number between 0 and 9 will show up and if the user remembers it and submits the right number, it will proceed to the next round where it will add another digit and the user must remember and submit both the first digit and the newly added one (3 digits on round 3, 4 digits on round 4, etc.)


Every round that progresses will cause the timer to become shorter and shorter meaning the user must remember in a shorter amount of time


If the user forgets and enters the wrong number, they will lose the game and be prompted to an end game screen with restart or return to the main menu buttons


Users can view the entire code that they were unable to remember at the end of the game on the end game screen


Users can play the hard mode which ups the difficulty by adding letters and numbers onto the code the player must remember (i.e it could be 0-9 or a-z for each digit)


Users can access a leaderboard which will show other playerâ€™s scores that have played the game before and compete to beat their scores


In normal mode, players will gain score for each time they remember the digit correctly


In hard mode, the player receives more points for each round since there is more to remember 


While playing the game, the user can see a bar representing the time they have left during a round
